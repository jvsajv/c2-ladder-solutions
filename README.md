# c2-ladder-solutions
A simple repo with the c2-ladder solutions I coded.

Each file will have the code of the question as name `XXXX_A.py`

> Example:
>> https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1551/A
>> 1551_A.py

Some questions will have more versions with `vX` after the question code `XXXX_A_v2.py`

Access my progress trough my notion website with the table, the idea is to update you about the full list of questions:
